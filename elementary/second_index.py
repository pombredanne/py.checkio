Second Index.

You are given two strings and you have to find an index
of the second occurrence of the second string in the first one.

Let's go through the first example where you need to find the second occurrence of "s" in a word "sims".
Itâ€™s easy to find its first occurrence with a function
index or find which will point out that "s" is the first symbol in a word "sims"
and therefore the index of the first occurrence is 0.
But we have to find the second "s" which is 4th in a row and that
means that the index of the second occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 3.

Input: Two strings.
Output: Int or None

def second_index(text: str, symbol: str) -> [int, None]:
    """
    Returns the second index of a symbol in a given text
    """

    return len("".join(text.split(symbol)[:2])) + 1 if text.count(symbol) > 1 else None


if __name__ == "__main__":
    assert second_index("sims", "s") == 3, "First"
    assert second_index("find the river", "e") == 12, "Second"
    assert second_index("hi", " ") is None, "Third"
    assert second_index("hi mayor", " ") is None, "Fourth"
    assert second_index("hi mr Mayor", " ") == 5, "Fifth"
